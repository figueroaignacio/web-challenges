# Frontend Mentor - Blog preview card solution

This is a solution to the [Blog preview card challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/blog-preview-card-ckPaj01IcS). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

## What I Learned

Working on this project helped me practice:

1. Structuring a small component using semantic HTML.
2. Styling with CSS while maintaining responsiveness.
3. Using BEM methodology for consistent and maintainable code.

## Acknowledgments
